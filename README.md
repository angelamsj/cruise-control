Cruise control using Elma
===

This project consists on extending the cruise control Elma application. This extended version will include a more sofisticated model of the dynamics of the car and a PID controller. To evaluate the performance of the system, data aquired from simulations will be plotted. This project builds upon the Elma library: https://github.com/klavinslab/elma.git.
